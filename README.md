# Gradient Descent: Optimization and Regression Applications
https://mina-tj.github.io/Gradient-Descent-Optimization-Regression/

This repository contains an academic statistics assignment focused on implementing
gradient descent from scratch for optimization and regression problems.

Part A applies gradient descent to a cost optimization problem using a synthetic
manufacturing dataset, where the goal is to determine the optimal production batch
size that minimizes total monthly cost.

Part B applies gradient descent to an energy consumption dataset that relates
building energy usage to temperature. The analysis models a non-linear (U-shaped)
relationship using quadratic regression and compares gradient descent with OLS.

The assignment emphasizes both mathematical understanding and practical interpretation.
All code, visualizations, and explanations are presented in the HTML report.
